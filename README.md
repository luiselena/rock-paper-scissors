# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Classic version of the game.

This game is made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It was based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) from FreeCodeCamp, so props to them.

The goal now is to add Lizard-Spock to the game. To facilitate the task and keep things uniform, the images are already in place. âœ…

Next assignment: to learn some Typescript. Let's convert `app.js` to `app.ts`.

## To run the game locally:

1. Make sure you have _NodeJS_ installed. Any version will do.

2. In the game directory just run `npm install` to install the packages needed.

3. Run `npm run dev` to run game.

4. Open you browser in _http://localhost:3000_.
